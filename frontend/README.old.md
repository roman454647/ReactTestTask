## Submission frontend [TODO]

1. End goal is to create a simple page with simple functionality: 
    - table with list of users from `users` endpoint at the top of the page
    - under the table - form with 3 fields (name, email - required, age - optional) and submit button (posting new user to `users` endpoint).
    - fields and button should be inlined (aligned horizontally)
    - after submission we should initialize new request for the list of users and display new data in a table (so there will be no "optimistic update")
    
2. Technologies to use
    - Typescript (feel free to use TS template of CRA)
    - React (preferably with hooks)
    - Redux
    - Saga (we have async actions here, so api calls should be in sagas)
    - Material-ui (all fields/tables/buttons can be just taken from ui library, use JSS styling if it is necessary to align buttons horizontally)
    - Formik (to handle form. Form state may not be placed in redux)
    - Yup (to handle validation of form fields)
